# METRCassemble
This repository creates CSV files for upload to METRC.

## Wut?!
This repository currently handles input through an A&D scale, Zebra Scanner, and keyboard to create a METRC-compliant CSV to upload weighed items

## Why?
I need it to help streamline operations in a cannabis grow operation.
